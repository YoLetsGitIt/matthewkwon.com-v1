## Why I made this website

At the time of developing this website and writing this blog post, I am currently unemployed as a fresh Masters graduate and need a job to pay my rent and bills.  
  
Scouring through the LinkedIn job board, I noticed that most software or design jobs had an option for me to add a link to my website/portfolio, so I built and published this website with hopes that my applications would get me more interviews.  
  
Besides that, I always wanted to start a website to showcase my personality and work, and this was the perfect opportunity to have a cool web project as part of my work. I plan to constantly iterate on this website in the future.


## Blogging

This is not only the start of my portfolio journey, but also a start to my blogs. I wanted to start vlogging for two reasons:  
  
1. I wanted to practise my writing  
2. I wanted a record of my professional/technical learnings  
  
Being a software engineering grad, I haven’t had much chance to write about anything in general since high school, and I hope that blogging about the things I’m passionate about will be a way for me to enjoy writing for the first time in my life. I have hopes that my blogs are going to contain anything that I want to write about, ranging from anything technical, personal and professional learnings, and maybe even movie reviews. I’m not 100% sure on the direction of my blogs yet but I’ll see where it takes me.

## Inspiration

I looked at a range of developer portfolios for inspiration before starting the design for this iteration, and I was most influenced by Robb (https://robbowen.digital/) and Britney’s (https://brittanychiang.com/) website. My web development skills aren’t quite brushed up yet, so I had to have a good balance of what I think is cool and what is technically achievable. Britney’s website was what I referenced in terms of the content and layout, whereas my colours and aesthetic were influenced by Robb’s website.

## Tech Stack
I wanted to have this website published ASAP for my job applications, so it was developed using React, the framework that I am most familiar with right now. I still wanted to pick up something new and have a kick to my website, so I looked into 3D animations and came across Three.js. I watched a few tutorials on this a quickly whipped up two animations for my website based on the logo that I made on Figma in less than 5 minutes.
