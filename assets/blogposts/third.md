## Why did I start journaling?

Due to some of the bad things that have been happening in my life, I've been having cycles of periods where I would feel chronically down.
These cycles affected both my mental and physical health, as I would become so unproductive, to the point I would lay in bed all day and do
nothing but be on my phone. 

I'm trying to take more control over how these cycles and more generally, my emotions affect my life, and I believe journaling will help me
to do this. 

## My novice journaling strategy

I'm physically writing in a little notebook I bought from MUJI, and trying to limit myself to one page a day. I'm trying to write instead of
type because my therapist told me that physically writing has a more powerful impact on your brain. I'm also trying to limit myself to one
page a day to make sure I'm being concise with my words and not overwriting. 

I have a rough guideline of how I journal and it follows this format: 

- Date
- Body
    - Things that happened during the day
    - How I felt from the things that happened
    - Why did I feel these emotions
- How can I improve to feel less of the negative emotions and more of the positive emotions
- A self-assuring message

This format just came about from my first journal entry. I really enjoyed it and after analysing it, it followed the above format so I'm 
trying to stick to it for now. 

This may be the last post about journaling, but I will post updates if there are any drastic changes to my jouraling journey or strategy.
